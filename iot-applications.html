      <h1 class="text-center">What is IoT Applications?</h1><br>
     <p class="def">The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical objects, devices, vehicles, buildings, and other
        items that are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, enabling them to collect and exchange data
        with each other and with other systems over the internet.Building IoT applications requires a combination of skills in software 
        development, hardware engineering, and data analytics. Therefore, the essential skillsets can be:
      Programming skills,User interface design skills and Networking skills (Understanding of networking protocols such as TCP/IP, MQTT, and CoAP are crucial for building 
      IoT applications that connect devices and systems over the internet).</p><br>

      <h4>Most popular cases of IoT Examples:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>(1) Smart Homes: </strong> IoT devices such as smart thermostats, lighting systems, and home security systems can be
        remotely
        controlled via mobile devices or voice commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2) Healthcare:</strong> Wearable devices, remote monitoring sensors, and medical equipment can transmit real-time data
        to
        healthcare providers, allowing for remote monitoring and patient care.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3) Manufacturing:</strong> IoT sensors and connected devices can be used to optimize production processes, reduce
        downtime,
        and improve efficiency in manufacturing facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>(4) Smart Cities:</strong> IoT sensors and systems can be used to optimize city services such as traffic management, waste
        management, and energy consumption, leading to more sustainable and efficient urban environments.
      </p><br>

      <h2>Activity 1:</h2>
      <p>First activity was about <strong>IoT Apps</strong> which refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles,
        home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity which enables
        these objects to connect and exchange data. Also, there are some main features needed for IoT application such
        as connectivity,
        sensors, user interface and security. Lastly few examples of IoT are Wearables such as fitness trackers and
        smartwatches, connected cars with features such as GPS, diagnostics, and entertainment systems and Industrial
        IoT with
        connected machines, sensors, and robotics in manufacturing and production.</p>

      <h2>Activity 2:</h2>
      <p>Second activity was about <strong>Smart Building.</strong> It is a building equipped with advanced technology
        to optimize its functions, enhance comfort, and improve efficiency. This technology includes automation
        systems, sensors, and data
        analytics to monitor and control various aspects of the building, such as heating, cooling, lighting,
        security, and energy
        use. Some scenarios of this buidling include energy management, security and access control and lighting
        control.</p>

      <h2>Activity 3:</h2>
      <p>Third activity was about <strong>Control Interface </strong>which has some high level features that includes
        real-time monitoring, data visualization, alarms and user management. The parts needed to create a control
        interface for an IoT
        application can include hardware, software and network components. Lastly the users are building managers,
        operators, service
        providers and developers.

              us to remotely operate and monitor our home via an app on our smartphone. It manages the
              surveillance in and around the home, along with keeping track of who has access to the doors if they are
              equipped with smart locks. Smart security systems gives us peace of mind while we are away.</strong>

            <strong class="text-dark">The healthcare sector faces the challenge of curbing the rate at which patient's
              time is wasted when
              they visit hospitals. They are either left frustrated or tend to pay sums of monies to jump queues to
              receive medical care from doctors. Furthermore, this challenge is known to be caused by the manual nature
              of booking appointments at hospitals. In order to solve this situation, Hospital Reservation System
              (HRS) can help improve patient and doctor appointment bookings at hospitals. It aims to reduce and
              eradicate the manual process associated with hospital appointment bookings and also balance the load
              between
              a doctor and its patients.</strong>
